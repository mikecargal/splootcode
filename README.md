# SplootCode Editor

An experimental coding interface that's tree-based.

For progress updates, please join the mailing list on [splootcode.io](https://splootcode.io/).

With a regular text-based programming language, the first step to process it is to parse it into an abstract-syntax-tree.
In the SplootCode editor, the user edits the tree directly and that tree can then include more semantic meaning.

Code no longer has to rely on cryptic punctuation characters and whitespace to represent structure. Instead the layout can be auto-generated, depending on screen size and user preferences.

That being said, building a tree-editing interface that's fast, compact and intuitive is no easy feat. This is very much a work in progress.

## Goals

- An unrestricted implementation of JavaScript
- Fast and easy to edit using a keyboard and autocomplete
- A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Help developers avoid syntax errors and other common programming errors
- Avoid busywork like escaping, bracket matching, wrapping and whitespace
- Let beginners focus on the logic of their code rather than the syntax

## Development

### Requirements

You'll need to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

### Local Dev

Install dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Generate type information for built-in Javascript variables and functions.

```
$ yarn generate-types
```

There are two parts to this project, the editor and the runtime which is the iframe which executes the code.
You will need to build the compiled assests for both the main editor and the frame.

```
$ yarn build && yarn build-frame
```

This app depends on firebase, but the tools are installs by yarn. Start the firebase emulator like this:

```
$ yarn start
```

The app should now become availble at `http://localhost:4999`.

If you want to continually rebuild as you change the code, run this (rebuilds the editor only):

```
$ yarn watch
```

And in a separate terminal, run this to continually rebuild the frame:

```
$ yarn watch-frame`
```
